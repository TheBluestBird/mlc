# This is a default autogenerated MLC config
# The syntax goes like this:
# key value
# Only the first occasion of the valid key value pair is taken to consideration
#
# Use # sign for comments
#
# All printed commented out values are default values
#
# You should have one of this files as ~/.config/mlc.conf,
# if you have started mlc at least once.
# This is going to be used every time you launch mlc,
# so, edit it if you wish to change default behavior.
#
# Alternatively, you can launch `mlc -c customConfig.conf`
# if you wish to override ~/.config/mlc.conf file

# Log level, regulates minimal message severity to be printed
# Allowed values are: [debug, info, minor, major, warning, error, fatal]
#level info

# Output type
# Allowed values are: [mp3] (more coming soon)
#type mp3

# Source collection path
# This is a default path to your music collection source.
# It's useful to set it when you always encode the same collection
# Leaving this empty (as it is by default) will make you always
# specify source in the command line
#source

# Destination path
# This is a default path for your encoding destination
# It's useful to set it when you often encode your collection
# to the same output
# Leaving this empty (as it is by default) will make you always
# specify destination in the command line
#destination

# Parallel tasks
# Defines how many threads are going to be started in parallel
# Allowed values are [0, 1, 2, 3 ...] etc
# If it's set to 0 - amount of threads is going to be
# as high as your processor can effectively handle
#parallel 0

# Non music files
# MLC copies any non-music file it finds in source directory
# if it matches the following regex
# Allowed value are: [all, none] or regex without any additional syntax,
# for example: filesToCopy cover\.jpe?g
#filesToCopy all

# Encoding quality
# Sets up encoding quality (NOT OUTPUT QUALITY)
# The higher quality the slower the encoding process
# 0 is the highest quality and slowest process
# 9 is the lowest quality and the fastest process fastest
# Allowed values are: [0, 1, 2, ... 9]
#encodingQuality 0

# Output quality
# Sets up output quality
# The higher quality the less information is lost in compression
# 0 is the highest possible quality for selected mode and type and results in the biggest file
# 9 is the lowest quality but results in the smallest file
# Allowed values are [0, 1, 2, ... 9]
# For the constant bitrate modes (CBR) the following table is valid
# Quality | MP3 |
# --------+-----+--
#       0 | 320 |
# --------+-----+--
#       1 | 288 |
# --------+-----+--
#       2 | 256 |
# --------+-----+--
#       3 | 224 |
# --------+-----+--
#       4 | 192 |
# --------+-----+--
#       5 | 160 |
# --------+-----+--
#       6 | 128 |
# --------+-----+--
#       7 |  96 |
# --------+-----+--
#       8 |  64 |
# --------+-----+--
#       9 |  32 |
#outputQuality 0

# Variable bitrate
# Switches on or off variable bitrate
# VBR files are usually smaller, but not supped to be worse
# in terms of quality. VBR files might be a bit more tricky for the player
# Allowed values are: [true, false]
#vbr true
