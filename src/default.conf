# This is a default autogenerated MLC config
# The syntax goes like this:
# key value
#
# Use # sign for comments
#
# All printed comented out values are default values
#
# You should have one of this files as ~/.config/mlc.conf,
# if you have started mlc at least once.
# This is going to be used every time you launch mlc,
# so, edit it if you wish to change default behaviour.
#
# Alternatively, you can launch `mlc -c customConfig.conf`
# if you wish to override ~/.config/mlc.conf file

# Log level, regulates minimal message severity to be printed
# Allowed values are: debug, info, minor, major, warning, error, fatal
#level info
